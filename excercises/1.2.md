The three way lamp can be modeled in several ways. Which is best would depend on the physical type of lamp we are acutally
implementing. A lamp like this could have four separate buttons or some kind of 4 way switch. It could also have a single
button which cycles through the options. Two examples are given below.

The setting could be held in several ways. It could be an integer representing it's relative state. It could be a string
or some kind of enumeration holding all settings. Whichever is nicest would depend on the context of the model.
In either case it should hold it's setting and have some function to allow the user to change it's setting.

Three way lamp as a *cycling* lamp
```java
    public class ThreeWayLamp {
        private int setting = 0;
        private final String[] settings = [
            'OFF',
            'LOW',
            'MEDIUM',
            'HIGH'
        ];

        public Setting currentSetting () {
            // ...
        }

        public void  onButtonPressed () {
            // ...
        }
    }
```

Three way lamp with separate buttons
```java
    public enum Setting = {
        OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
    }

    public class ThreeWayLamp {
        private Setting setting = Setting.OFF;

        public Setting currentSetting () {
            // ...
        }

        public void  updateSetting (Setting newSetting) {
            // ...
        }
    }
```


Separate handles for separate settings
```java
    public class ThreeWayLamp {
        private Setting setting = Setting.OFF;

        public Setting currentSetting () {
            // ...
        }

        public void  turnOff () {
            // ...
        }

        public void  setLow () {
            // ...
        }

        public void  setMedium () {
            // ...
        }

        public void setHigh () {
        }
    }
```
