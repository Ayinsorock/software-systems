# Sofware Systems

## Exercises
Non programming exercises can be found under `/exercises`. The file name indicates the assignment in Nino.
Programming exercises should be in `ss/week[weekNo]/`. This is where the provided code will also live so it might
be somewhat cluttered.

## Notes
Notes can be found under `/notes`. The file name indicates the module, week and lecture. So `P1A` holds the first
lecture of the first week of the programming module.
